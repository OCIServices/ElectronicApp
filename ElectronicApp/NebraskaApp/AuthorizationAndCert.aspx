              <p class="auth">I understand and agree with the following statements with regard to my application for coverage through an insurance carrier: </p>           
              <ul style="margin-left: 50px">
                <li>My dependents are not eligible for coverages I don't have. My dependents, including step and foster children and any over the maximum age, are eligible based on plan
provisions, but those over the maximum age will be verified when a claim is filed. I have read and understand the Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion and the Special Enrollment
Rights and know if I refuse medical coverage, I and my dependents must wait for the next open enrollment unless I become eligible during a Special Enrollment. If I refuse
dental coverage, I and my dependents may enroll later, but this will affect the level of benefits. If I refuse life or disability coverage, I may apply later, but I must show proof of
good health, and coverage will be subject to approval by the Carrier. If I refuse coverage, I cannot enroll after retirement.</li>
<li>
I understand that the coverage applied for will not start until after this application and the appropriate coverage rates are received and accepted by the Carrier and an effective
date of coverage is established by the Carrier. I further agree that the Carrier is not liable for a claim before the effective date of coverage and all policy provisions apply. During
the first two years coverage for life or disability or medical is in force, false statements, omissions or material misrepresentations can cause changes in that coverage, including
cancellation back to the effective date.
</li>
<li>
Any person who, with intent to defraud or knowingly is facilitating a fraud against an insurer, submits an application or files a claim with false or deceptive statements, may be
guilty of insurance fraud.
</li>
<li>
For life and disability coverages, I authorize any health care provider who has personal information - including physical, mental, drug or alcohol use history - regarding me or a
dependent, to give such data to the Life or Disability Carrier agents and employees of the Life or Disability Carrier and I authorize the Life or Disability Carrier to release data as
required by law. If signed in connection with an application, reinstatement or a change in benefits, this form will be valid two years from the date below. I may revoke
authorization for information not yet obtained. I understand data obtained will be used by the Life or Disability Carrier for determining eligibility for life and disability coverage.
Information will not be used for any purposes prohibited by law.
</li>
<li>
I also understand collection of social security numbers for myself and my dependents will be used by the Carrier only as allowed by law.
</li>
<li>
For life coverage, I understand that as the employee, the insurance I and my dependents have applied for will begin on the effective date of coverage, provided I am at work on
that date. If I am not actively at work on such date - subject to the terms of the group policy - coverage may not go into effect until after my return to work. Furthermore, I
understand that no insurance may become effective for any member of my family while he/she is in a period of limited activity.
</li>
<li>
For medical coverage, I authorize pharmacy benefit managers, "health care providers," including, but not limited to, surgeons, physicians, psychologists, nurses, social
workers, health care facilities and other entities covered under the HIPAA Privacy Rule and their agents and employees, to release and disclose my personal health information,
including, but not limited to, all health and mental records, including those records protected by Federal or State law relating to the diagnosis or treatment of AIDS or AIDSrelated
complex, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, sexually transmitted diseases, mental health and substance abuse, the use of alcohol, drugs and tobacco, and
the past, present or future treatments or conditions for myself or for my dependents eligible for health care coverage to the Carrier, its agents and employees, for purposes of
underwriting my application for coverage, and making eligibility, premium rating and enrollment decisions relating to any coverage I have, have applied for or may in the future
apply for with the Carrier or other entities covered under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. I further understand that the personal health information described above may be disclosed to persons or organizations that are not health plans, covered health are providers or health care clearinghouses subject to federal health information privacy laws. They may further
disclose the protected health information, and it may no longer be protected by federal health information privacy laws. This authorization shall remain in force two years following
the date of my signature. I may revoke this authorization in writing at any time by sending the request for revocation to the Carrier. I understand that a revocation is not effective
until received by the Carrier and that any revocation is not effective to the extent the Carrier or Providers have relied on the protected health information disclosed to them. This
Authorization and Certification does not authorize the redisclosure of medical information except as otherwise stated herein. Federal and State regulations do not allow further
disclosure of mental health, substance abuse and AIDS/HIV related information. The Carrier maintains the confidentiality ofall information received and it will not be released to
any person or facility unless you apply for life and/or disability coverage underwritten by the Life or Disability Carrier in which case the application, without any further health
records or Attending Physician Statements (APS) received, will be released to the Life or Disability Carrier. I understand that if I refuse this authorization, the Carrier may not
make an eligibility determination, and I will not be considered for coverage with the Carrier.
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<p>I hereby authorize the following Carriers, their reinsurers and their legal representatives to receive, use and disclose my, my spouse and my dependent child(ren)'s Protected
Health Information for the purposes of insurance coverage. I authorize the Carriers to disclose my, my spouse and my dependent child(ren)'s Protected Health Information
between themselves, to reinsuring companies, to the plan administrator or plan sponsor (if other than the employer), insurance intermediaries or other persons or organizations
performing business or legal services in connection with the purpose of insurance coverage: (Either you or your broker must list all Carriers that are to receive this application for
insurance).</p>

<p>I certify that I am legally authorized to apply for coverage for myself and all other persons named in this application. I further certify that, after this application was completed, I carefully and fully read it, that the statements and answers set forth are full, true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that no information required to be given, either expressly or by implication, has been knowingly withheld.

I understand that the Carrier will rely on the completeness and truthfulness of the information given and the statements made, and that if I have made any false statements or misrepresentations, or have failed to disclose or concealed any material fact, the Carrier will be entitled to declare any contract or coverage issued pursuant to this application void and to refuse allowance on benefits to any person thereunder, which means that any claims incurred will become my liability.

If the group policy does not require my contribution, I understand that I cannot decline any coverage unless the policy indicates otherwise. If the group policy requires my contribution, I authorize my employer to deduct from my pay. I understand an agent or broker cannot guarantee coverage, revise rates, benefits or provisions without written approval from the Carrier.</p>
